# Crab Analysis
In this project we will use python to clean and perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information on crab ages, genders, weights, and sizes.

## Content Overview
### `exploration.py`
In this script we first read, clean, and preprocess the dataset `CrabAgePrediction.csv`.  

The dataframe obtained has the following features.

| Feature | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| Sex | Sex of the crab (three values: Male, Female and Indeterminate). |
| Length | Length of the crab (in feet). |
| Diameter | Diameter of the Crab (in feet). |
| Height | Height of the crab (in feet). |
| Weight | Weight of the crab (in oounces). |
| Shucked Weight | Weight without shell (in ounces). |
| Viscera Weight| Weight of the material around crab's abdominal organs (in ounces). |
| Shell Weight | Weight of the shell (in ounces). |
| Age | Age of the crab (in months). |
